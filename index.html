        <p class="para">Windows 11 is the next client operating system, and includes features that organizations should know. Windows 11 is built on the same foundation as Windows 10. If you use Windows 10, then Windows 11 is a natural transition and update to what you know, and what you're familiar with.

            It offers innovations focused on enhancing end-user productivity, and is designed to support today's hybrid work environment.
            
            Your investments in update and device management are carried forward. For example, many of the same apps and tools can be used in Windows 11. Many of the same security settings and policies can be applied to Windows 11 devices, including PCs. You can use Windows Autopilot with a zero touch deployment to enroll your Windows devices in Microsoft Endpoint Manager. You can also use newer features, such as Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365 on your Windows 11 devices.</p>
